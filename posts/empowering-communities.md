# Empowering Communities Through Technology

At Spread the World, we believe in the transformative power of technology education. Our mission to bring computer literacy to disenfranchised Mesoamericans is more than just teaching basic computer skillsâ€”it's about opening doors to new opportunities and connecting communities to the global digital landscape.

## The Digital Divide in Mesoamerica

Many communities in Mesoamerica lack access to basic computer technology and the internet. This digital divide creates significant barriers to education, economic opportunities, and global connectivity. Our work aims to bridge this gap and empower individuals with the skills they need to thrive in the digital age.

## Our Approach

1. **Community-Centered Learning**: We work closely with local leaders to understand the unique needs of each community we serve.
2. **Sustainable Technology**: We provide durable, low-cost computers and establish community internet hubs.
3. **Comprehensive Curriculum**: Our program covers everything from basic computer operations to internet safety and online research skills.
4. **Train-the-Trainer Model**: We train local educators to ensure the sustainability of our programs.

## Success Stories

Maria, a young woman from rural Guatemala, used her new computer skills to start an online business selling traditional textiles. Her success has inspired others in her community to embrace technology as a tool for economic empowerment.

## How You Can Help

Your support can make a significant difference in the lives of Mesoamerican communities. Consider donating to fund our programs, or volunteer your time and skills to help us spread digital literacy.

Together, we can bridge the digital divide and create a more connected, empowered Mesoamerica.
